# 📧 Naive Bayes Email Spam Detection


````markdown

This project uses the **Naive Bayes Classifier**, a probabilistic machine learning algorithm, to detect whether an email is **spam** or **not spam** based on its content. It demonstrates a complete NLP pipeline: from preprocessing to vectorization and classification.

---

## 🧠 Model Used

- **Multinomial Naive Bayes** from `sklearn.naive_bayes`
- Suited for document classification and bag-of-words features
- Predicts `spam (1)` or `not spam (0)`

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset typically contains:
- A column for **email text** or messages
- A **label column**: `1` for spam, `0` for ham (not spam)

If a CSV or custom dataset is used, place it in the project folder.

---

## 📦 Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `nltk` or `re` (if using text preprocessing)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-detector-naive-bayes.git
   cd spam-detector-naive-bayes
   ```
2. Launch the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Naive-Bayes-Classifier-Email-Spam-Detection.ipynb
   ```

3. (Optional) Run a script version:

   ```bash
   python spam_detector.py
   ```

## 🔍 Workflow

* ✅ Load dataset
* 🧹 Preprocess text (lowercasing, punctuation removal, tokenization)
* 🔢 Convert text to numeric features using:

  * `CountVectorizer` or
  * `TfidfVectorizer`
* 🧠 Train Naive Bayes classifier
* 🎯 Predict and evaluate model on test data

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy
* Confusion Matrix
* Precision / Recall / F1 Score
* ROC Curve (optional)

---

## ✅ Sample Output

```python
model.predict(["Free entry in a competition now!!"])
# Output: [1]  # Means spam
```
